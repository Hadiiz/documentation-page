      <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
      <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>

      <p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
        <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
        <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
        <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
        <li>Readability counts.</li>

      <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>
      <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>
      <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>
      <p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.</p>
      <p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>

      <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
      <code>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> <mark class="green">2</mark> +<mark class="green"> 2</mark></p>
        4
      </code>

    <article>
      <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
      <code>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></orange> <mark class="blue">'spam eggs' # single quotes</mark></p>
        <p>'spam eggs'</p>
      </code>

    <header>Lists</header>
    <article>
      <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
      <code>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> squares = [<mark class="green">1</mark>, <mark class="green">4</mark>, <mark class="green">9</mark>, <mark class="green">16</mark>, <mark class="green">25</mark>]</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> squares</p>
        <p>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</p>
      </code>
      <p>All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list:</p>
      <code>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> squares[:]</p>
        <p>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</p>
      </code>

    <header>If Statements</header>
    <article>
      <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <mark class="blue">if</mark> statement. For example:</p>
      <code>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> x = <mark class="green">int</mark>(<mark class="green">input</mark>(<mark class="blue">"Please enter an integer: "</mark>))</p>
        <p>Please enter an integer: 42</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">>>></mark> <mark class="green">if</mark> x < <mark class="green">0</mark>:</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> x =<mark class="green"> 0</mark></p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">print</mark>(<mark class="blue">'Negative changed to zero'</mark>)</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">elif</mark> x == <mark class="green">0</mark>:</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">print</mark>(<mark class="blue">'Zero'</mark>)</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">elif</mark> x == <mark class="green">1</mark>:</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">print</mark>(<mark class="blue">'Single'</mark>)</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">else</mark>:</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark> <mark class="green">print</mark>(<mark class="blue">'More'</mark>)</p>
        <p><mark class="orange">...</mark></p>
        <p>More</p>
